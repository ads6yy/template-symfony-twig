# Symfony + Twig Reference

This repository serves as a **reference implementation** for standard web application features using **Symfony** and **Twig**.

Instead of being a blank starter kit, this project implements "classic" functionalities in a standard, best-practice way. It is designed to act as a code bank or knowledge base that I can refer to when building future projects, ensuring I have a reliable example of how to implement core features without reinventing the wheel.
